Physics-based game

Process requirements:

Where to play your game (a link to your deployed game):


How all of your data assets (if you have any) were created: 
        Shapes were created by me in Adobe Illustrator.

Experience requirements:

The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player:
        Discrete inputs such as clicking buttons
        Continuous inputs such as dragging objects

The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact):
        Player must stack objects to reach a specific height while dealing with the physics engine.

3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass):
        3 physics-based levels with increasing difficulty.

Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes:
        3 results screens that rate the player based on how many obbjects they spawned.
